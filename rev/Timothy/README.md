# Timothy

FLAG = "Breach{N0t_Q2it3_Tu4in6_C0mp28t3_81923}"


In a land far far away there lived timothy.
Dumb he may be, but he worked hard and quite nicely.
Wanted to make create sommething unique and new.
As he kept working on what was given to him, the complexity grew.

Tired, he never was. For you see...
He did many a great things just from simplicity.

But all of the kings horses, and all of the king's men.
Wanted to know what how Timothy's work began.
And though I may be running out out words to make a rhyme...
I hope you can undo his work with his friend Anthony's help and reveal what was lost to time.
